### Disclaimer: The "War Games" Rule

This is a real-world arsenal, not a playground. The scripts provided here are powerful tools that can modify your system and your data.

1.  **You are your own support.** These scripts are provided "as-is", without warranty of any kind. I am not responsible for any data loss, system failure, or any other damage that may result from their use.
2.  **Understand before you execute.** Never run a script on your system that you do not fully understand. The book provides the context; it is your responsibility to learn it.
3.  **Test everything.** Always test these scripts in a non-critical environment before deploying them on your live data.

By using the code in this repository, you agree that you are the sole person responsible for the outcome. This is the core principle of Digital Sovereignty.
