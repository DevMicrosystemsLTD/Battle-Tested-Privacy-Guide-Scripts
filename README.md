# Build Your Private Cloud: Official Script Arsenal

This is the official code arsenal for the book, **"Build Your Private Cloud"** by Antonio Michelotti.

These aren't just scripts to *build*. They are forged from a **"Build and Break"** philosophyâ€”a 30-year doctrine of understanding systems so deeply that you can bend them to your will. These are tools to achieve true digital sovereignty.

### Get The Book

These scripts are the weapons. The book is the **field manual** that teaches you the strategy behind them.

### How to Use This Arsenal

The repository is organized by chapter. Each folder contains the weapons (scripts and configuration files) referenced in the corresponding chapter of the book.

*   `/chapter-04`: Scripts for The Automated Army
*   `/chapter-05`: Scripts & configurations for The Sentinel Protocol
*   *(...and so on...)*

**Do not copy and paste code from the book's pages.** That is a rookie mistake. Clone this repository or download the specific raw file you need.

### The "Build & Break" Rule (Disclaimer)

This is a real-world arsenal, not a playground. Our motto is **"Build and Break!"** This means you are in control, and you are responsible.

1.  **You Are Your Own Support.** These scripts are provided "as-is", without warranty. I am not responsible for any data loss or system failure.
2.  **Understand Before You Execute.** Never run a script you do not fully understand. The book provides the context; it is your responsibility to learn it.
3.  **Test Everything.** Test in a non-critical environment before deploying on your live data.

By using this code, you agree that you are the sole person responsible for the outcome. This is the core principle of Digital Sovereignty.
